/*	The HEVC decoder block of the BCM2711 (Raspberry Pi 4), for the program
	that parses the stream: /dev/misc/rpi_hevc.

	The block decodes a picture in two phases. The first reads the slice
	data (CABAC) as a list of register writes tells it to, and leaves
	prediction units and coefficients in two buffers; the second makes the
	picture from those and the reference pictures. Each phase ends with an
	interrupt. Everything the block reads and writes is physically
	contiguous memory, which this driver hands out: a buffer is an area the
	program clones, and it goes away with the file descriptor.

	The driver knows nothing of HEVC. It checks that the buffers named are
	the caller's own, keeps the CPU cache out of the way, and waits for the
	interrupts. Phase one of a picture may run while phase two of the one
	before does. */
