/*	The video decoder (Cedar "VE") of the Allwinner A733, for the program that
	parses the stream: /dev/misc/sunxi_ve.

	The program does everything codec specific. It parses the parameter
	sets and slice headers, keeps the reference pictures, and describes one
	slice at a time as a list of register writes (SUNXI_VE_RUN). The last
	write starts the engine; the driver waits for its interrupt and returns
	the engine's status. Everything the engine reads and writes is
	physically contiguous memory below 4 GiB that this driver hands out: a
	buffer is an area the program clones, it goes away with the file
	descriptor, and its bus address is what the program writes into the
	registers. The CPU cache is not coherent with the engine: the program
	cleans what it wrote and invalidates what it is about to read
	(SUNXI_VE_SYNC).

	The driver powers the engine (PCK-600 domain, clocks, resets, IOMMU
	bypass) while the device is open, keeps the registers that control that
	to itself, and lets one slice run at a time. */
