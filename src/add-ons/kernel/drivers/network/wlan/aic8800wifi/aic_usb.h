/*	The AIC8800D80's USB side: its two USB identities (the ROM loader and
	the running firmware), the firmware load, and the running firmware's
	message and data pipes. Plain Haiku code under a small C API, like
	broadcomfmac's SDIO host; the driver proper (dev/aic) is OpenBSD code on
	the compatibility layers.

	The transport never takes the compatibility layer's Giant lock: a
	command's confirmation is matched on the transport's own receive
	threads, so a command may be waited for from any thread. */
