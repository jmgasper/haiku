# Displays on the Raspberry Pi 4

State 2026-10-07: both HDMI outputs are displays of one desktop, arranged
with the Screen preferences (or `screenmode`). The current lab configuration
detects both displays at 1920x1080 and uses a 3840x1080 desktop. HDMI0 is
visible through the KVM; HDMI1's physical picture has not been observed.
The earlier 640x480 forced-output tests below are historical.

## How it works

The firmware owns the compositor (HVS), output timing and PHY programming.
air/OS reads the connection signal and sends firmware KMS requests:

- `rpi_display` (`src/add-ons/kernel/drivers/graphics/rpi_display`) owns one
  frame buffer (contiguous, below 1 GB, write-combining) and asks the firmware
  for one plane per output with the "firmware KMS" property tag `SET_PLANE`
  (0x00048015): a source rectangle of the buffer, scaled to a destination
  rectangle on the output. No overlay in `config.txt` is needed for that.
- `rpi_display.accelerant` implements the fork's display layout hooks
  (`B_GET_DISPLAY_OUTPUTS`, `B_SET_DISPLAY_LAYOUT`, ...). app_server arranges
  the outputs; a layout becomes one frame buffer the size of the regions'
  bounding box, and the driver points each output's plane at its region.

Because the firmware scales, an output's *resolution* and its *scale* are both
just the size of its region: 1280x720 on a 1080p monitor, or 1920x1080 at
150 %, is a 1280x720 region shown full screen. A mirror shows its source's
region, letterboxed if the shapes differ. The kernel console follows the
frame buffer (`frame_buffer_update`); when app_server lets go, the planes are
removed and the firmware's own frame buffer (the boot console) shows again.

`config.txt` has `max_framebuffers=2` and `hdmi_force_hotplug:0=1` /
`hdmi_force_hotplug:1=1` to initialize both firmware pipelines even when a
monitor is absent at boot. Without that initialization, later detection and
layout changes succeed but the newly connected output does not produce a
picture. Real HPD, read by the driver, still controls the exposed desktop.

## Things to know about the firmware interface

- A plane names its display by the firmware's display **id** (2 = HDMI0,
  7 = HDMI1; `FRAMEBUFFER_GET_DISPLAY_ID`), not by the display number. With
  the number, the request is accepted and nothing shows.
- Plane ids count across the displays (three per display, as Linux's
  firmware-KMS driver has them). Two displays using plane id 0 ends with the
  second plane on the first display.
- The buffer address is a VideoCore bus address (physical | 0xc0000000).
- `GET_EDID_BLOCK_DISPLAY` also takes a firmware display **id**, not a
  framebuffer index. The 2026-10-07 candidate fixes this: index 1 had returned
  HDMI0's EDID, and the old duplicate-dropping workaround hid HDMI1's identity.
- The number of displays is what the firmware saw at boot; EDID responses can
  also remain cached after unplugging. Neither is a live connection signal.

## Hotplug

The driver retains two stable connectors (HDMI0/ID 2 and HDMI1/ID 7), independent
of boot-time enumeration. It reads BCM2711's `HDMI_HOTPLUG` bit every 250 ms,
requires two matching samples, and retries an unavailable EDID after two seconds.
The registers are read-only maps at `0xfef008a8` and `0xfef058a8`: the HDMI bases
from Linux's `bcm2711.dtsi`, plus the VC5 register offset `0x1a8`, bit 0.

On connection, checksum-validated EDID supplies a progressive detailed timing
(up to 300 MHz); an explicitly advertised VGA mode is the fallback. The driver
uses `SET_TIMING` (`0x00048017`) and `SET_DISPLAY_POWER` (`0x00048019`) with the
firmware display ID. The ABI follows Raspberry Pi Linux's
[`vc4_firmware_kms.c`](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/blob/rpi-5.15.y/drivers/gpu/drm/vc4/vc4_firmware_kms.c).
On disconnection it removes that plane. It sends the existing
`B_SET_DISPLAY_CHANGE_PORT` notification so app_server rearranges displays,
resizes the desktop, and moves windows away from the removed screen. Queries
use a snapshot copied under the driver lock instead of racing EDID updates.

Native evidence on 2026-10-07: three HDMI0 HPD disconnect/reconnect cycles,
triggered by the NanoKVM capture control, shrink 3840x1080 to the remaining
1920x1080 output and restore both outputs with a visible KVM picture. A separate
read-only probe verified HPD falls even though EDID remains available.
A boot with HDMI0 absent was also tested: the firmware initializes it at
640x480, the driver removes it from the desktop while HPD is low, and a later
connection selects 1920x1080 from EDID. Fresh video frames must be captured:
the NanoKVM stream's first frame can be stale, including a cached black frame.
The physical HDMI1 reconnect and picture still need observation.

## Earlier checks on the board (2026-10-03)

| What | How | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Two outputs in app_server | `screenmode -d` | HDMI-1 1920x1080 (EDID name, size), HDMI-2 640x480; desktop 2560x1080 |
| Lower resolution | `screenmode --display 1 --display-mode 1280x720` | region 1280x720 shown 1920x1080 |
| Scale | `--display 1 --scale 150` | region 1280x720, UI enlarged (`evidence/layout-swap.jpg`) |
| Arrangement | `--position` on both | HDMI0 shows the right-hand part of the desktop |
| Mirror | `--display 1 --mirror 2` | HDMI0 shows the 640x480 desktop letterboxed (`evidence/layout-mirror.jpg`) |
| Layout kept over a restart | restart | the saved layout comes back |
| Screen preferences | `evidence/screen-prefs.jpg` | both displays, arrangement, mirror, per-display resolution and scale |
| OpenGL | GLTeapot | renders as before (`evidence/teapot-rpidisplay.jpg`) |

## The lab's HDMI1

During the 3 October tests, the firmware reported one display unless
`hdmi_force_hotplug:1=1` was added to
`config.txt`, and read no EDID from HDMI1. The Linux recovery system saw
the same ("Registered
framebuffer for display 0" only). The cause was not established. By the
6 October performance run both outputs supplied 1080p modes without that
forced-output setting. This establishes detection, not HDMI1 picture quality;
the Dell monitor still needs a physical check.

## Open

- Hotplug mode selection supports progressive EDID detailed timings through
  300 MHz; interlaced modes and CTA modes with no usable DTD/VGA fallback are
  not supported. Only the lab's 1080p timings have native validation.
- No user-selectable physical timing changes, DPMS, hardware cursor
  (app_server draws the pointer), or vertical retrace semaphore.
- An output cannot be given more pixels than its mode (no shrinking).
