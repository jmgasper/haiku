# Check the workstation against what it is supposed to do, one line per thing.

# Every check here exists because something once looked fine and was not: a
# build that never installed, a driver the kernel never loaded, a screen saver
# that quietly turned the GPU path off, a Vulkan driver only visible to a shell
# with the right variables set. So nothing is run with anything set in its
# environment, and each check asks the machine rather than trusting that a
# thing was deployed.
