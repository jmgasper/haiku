# X399 workstation status

Status values are backed by observation on the workstation. Anything not
listed as verified is untested.

| Area | Goal | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Boot from NVMe (UEFI) | Haiku boots directly from the Samsung 950 PRO | verified: firmware boots `EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI` from the NVMe ESP; `/boot` is `/dev/disk/nvme/0/1` |
| SMP | all 32 hardware threads (16 cores) online | verified: `sysinfo` lists 32 CPUs |
| NVMe | disk available and bootable | verified after multi-root PCI fix: 2 GiB raw read at 1.6 GiB/s, boot volume |
| Ethernet | I211 up with DHCP | verified: ipro1000 link 1000BASE-T, DHCP lease, HTTP upload and SSH |
| USB | all controllers and ports enumerate devices | all 5 xHCI controllers start after the PCI fix; NanoKVM device enumerates on the ASM2142; other ports need physical devices |
| Audio | ALC1220 analog output, HDMI audio | AMD HDA and GP102 HDMI controllers attach (`/dev/audio/hmulti/hda/0,1`); playback untested |
| Graphics | GTX 1080 Ti accelerated 2D/3D, 3-4 monitors | in progress: loader support |
| Sleep | S3 suspend and resume | not implemented in Haiku |

## Log

- 2026-09-17: hardware inventory captured with SystemRescue. The NVMe
  contained an ARM64 Haiku test install from the ROCK 5 lab; its files,
  EFI partition and GPT were backed up before reuse.
- 2026-09-17: stock nightly (hrev60097) booted from NanoKVM virtual USB.
  The second Threadripper host bridge (root bus 0x40: NVMe, GPU, one CPU
  xHCI, one AHCI) was not enumerated. After reading every ACPI host bridge,
  its resource windows and `_PRT`, the NVMe, the fifth xHCI controller and
  the GPU's HDMI audio function appear.
- 2026-09-17: installed the system to the NVMe (GPT: FAT ESP + BFS "X399")
  from the live image and booted it without removable media.
